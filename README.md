HOW TO USE FAQ

Q. WTF is this program?

A. This program its an usefull tool to make your own 
DB of home finders, a really tipically thing at Argentina.

Q. Nice! and how i use this crap? 

A. If is your fist time at HF you will have to create DB
at Connect button in the menu DB, after that 
Do NOT introduce any charater at ID camp, its an 
autoincrement camp and he does all the work :). 
Finally fill other camps and press Create button 
for save the data at your DB. 

Q. Ok, cool. And other buttons? 

A. Use your brain my good friend, 
now you are able to write an ID number
for read, update or delete information of your DB.

Have a nice experience at HF v0.1
